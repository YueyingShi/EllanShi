	<H4>How often do couples meet?</H4>
	<p>
		Based on findings from Zhen'ai.com, one of China's major matchmaking platforms, a 2014 survey
		revealed that in China's top-tier cities, 54.5% of couples meet only once or twice a month, or
		even less frequently. Shockingly, 18.7% of these couples can't manage to meet at all for an
		entire year.
	</p>
	<H4>What is stopping them from meeting?</H4>
	<p>
		Further interviews were conducted to delve into the reasons behind the sparse encounters of
		these long-distance couples. We inquired about the factors hindering their ability to meet more
		frequently. Commonly cited reasons include demanding work schedules, geographical distance, and
		the challenges of busy, congested transportation systems.

<p>Here is some question we are looking into:</p>
<p>In general how many couples are in long-distance relationship?</p>
<p>What is the shared properties of the long-relationship couples?</p>
<p>From our research, we know more about our user - they are often both busy for work</p> -->
