	<p>
		A path full of magical luminescent mushrooms. Enchanting interaction. A unique and beautiful way
		to find your way. That is how visitors to Eindhoven University of Technology are guided through
		the site during GLOW, from one installation to another. Between all these installations, that's
		where the Wayfinding project shines. The mushrooms form an interactive system. Visitors can
		activate a mushroom, after which it glows and spreads its 'spores', which activate another
		mushroom nearby. This creates a chain reaction, which submerges the entire path - or parts of it
		- in a sea of ​​​​light.
