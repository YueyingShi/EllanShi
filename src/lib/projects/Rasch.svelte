<H4>Presence in Virtual Reality</H4>
<p>
	The rapid technological advancements in virtual environments (VE), networks, and computing power
	have elevated the potential for heightened user presence in VE. Presence, a crucial criterion for
	successful VE development, significantly influences emotional reflections, learning performance,
	and real-life task execution. To enhance this, a better measurement of presence is essential for
	creating more immersive VE entertainment and effective VR learning. Early presence research
	focused on defining it as "being there," with additional dimensions like social and environmental
	presence. Factors influencing presence are explored, and recent perspectives, such as the
	"illusion of non-mediation," highlight the immersive nature of the virtual experience.

<H4>Conventional Measurements of presence</H4>
<p>
	Numerous methods exist for measuring presence based on different conceptualizations.
	Traditionally, three approaches are employed: self-reports, behavioral observations, and
	physiological measures. Self-reports involve questionnaires and interviews, offering subjective
	feedback. While cost-effective and comparable between studies, they risk bias and may lack
	objectivity. Physiological measures, including EEG and heart rate, provide more objective insights
	but face limitations such as cost and sensitivity to content. Behavioral observation gauges
	real-life consistency, yet predicting participant reactions remains challenging. Conventional
	measures encounter issues of inconsistency and a lack of standardization. The proposed Rasch-based
	approach addresses these challenges by treating indicators as reflections of presence, not
	independent scales, and offering a flexible item bank for customized instruments, allowing
	comparison across studies without the need for standardized instruments.
