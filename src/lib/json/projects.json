		"I am a devoted fan of virtual reality, despite experiencing motion sickness. In 2016, I immersed myself in working with a healthcare research organization, exploring how virtual environments can elicit and measure human emotions. This experience inspired my master's thesis, where I continued to delve into this fascinating field.",

Traditionally, determining which VE is more immersive relied solely on subjective feelings. However, with the introduction of the Rasch Model, a powerful method based on observing user behavior that analyzes different studies in one domain on the same scale, we now have a more objective tool."],
