		"keywords": ["Research", "Virtual Reality"],
		"introduction": [
			"In today's tech-driven world, virtual environments (VE) show tremendous potential across various sectors. Evaluating the sense of presence in VEs is crucial for understanding user experiences. Existing methods struggle to align self-report, behavioral, and physiological indicators, lacking standardized tools for comparisons across studies. ",
			"Haans and IJsselsteijn (2018) introduced a solution with their Rasch model-based approach. This study validates its effectiveness through presence studies in pit and street VEs, showing successful cross-study comparisons. The findings underscore the method's usability and contribute valuable insights to enhance presence measurement tools, shaping the future of this field."
